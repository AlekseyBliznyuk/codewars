Codewars is where developers achieve code mastery through challenge. Train on kata in the dojo and reach your highest potential.

This repository includes kata that I have completed, as well as a handful of kata that I never completed.

The file name is the name of the Codewars kata.

THe languages are mostly Python 2.7. Some of them are also Python 3.6. I first learned Python in 2.7 and then started changing to 3.6.
